## Bio

I'm from Beijing, China. In the U.S., I completed my undergrad at University of Rochester where I double majored in **Data Science** and **Brain & Cognitive Sciences** with a minor in **Psychology**. 

To furthur develop my quantitative skills and leadership capability, I studied **Operations Research and Information Engineering** at Cornell University, in which I focused on utilizing **data analytics** to generate operational and business insights.

### Thoughts

Knowledge and skills that people possess are by no means scattered information or random actions, but most of them have certain “structures”. These “structures” are the models and **heuristics of the mind** that are developed through learning and vital in helping people perceive the world, analyze information, and make better decisions. 

Through my experience in learning and modeling human perception and cognition, I found that such models can be applied to practically any field, not only to natural science but also other domains such as the business field. 

As a next step, I wish to learn about the models in business, continue to develop my strong suit in data analytics and modeling and contribute to **advanced problem-solving and decision-making** under industry settings.
