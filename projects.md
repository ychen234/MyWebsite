### Engineering Design Project: Optimizing Purchase Orders and Inbound Flow Paths | Python
* Raised ordering efficiency by identifying opportunities for **purchase order consolidation** and delivered recommendations for different scenarios and the yearly consolidation plan by analyzing ordering data with 8 vendors.
* Drive system improvement by performing **cost analysis** to compare the current linehaul program with leveraging local third-party carriers.
* Developed a **dynamic optimization model** for shipment scheduling using integer programming.
* Increased transit utilization rate by **20%** by streamlining shipment scheduling and resource allocation.

### Bakery Production Analysis | Excel
* Developed **user-friendly dashboards** that visualize the impact of decisions and outcomes to enable discovery and diagnosis,
* Assessed current sales situation using the dashboard with built-in analysis tools (Pivot Tables, Data Validation, etc.).
* Identified best production quantity that maximizes profit by conducting **sensitivity analysis** and building robust **evaluation model** to evaluate daily profit and fill rate across all possible demand levels modeled as a normal distribution.

### Anomaly Detection | Python
* Developed a **machine learning model** to predict fraudulent transactions and built an alert system to prevent fraudulent activities.
* Performed **exploratory data analysis** on 138K+ transactions and **data preprocessing** by removing duplicates, encoding categorical features and handling imbalanced labeled data by **SMOTE**.
* Adopted **logistic regression** and **random forest** models, evaluated the models via 10-fold **cross validation** and found optimal model parameters via **grid search**, selected the best model based on AUC.

### Predictive Analytics for Demand Responsive Para-transportation | Python
* **Transformed, augmented, and cleaned** the raw dataset, conducted **time series** and **exploratory data analysis** on 102K+ observations and explored the correlations between customer cancellation and relevant features.
* Improved time and cost efficiency of daily trip schedule by leveraging **customer segmentation analysis** and tailored **classification models** (Weighted Random Forest, XGBoost) and predicting future cancellations.

### Database Design | MySQL
* Designed and implemented a **relational database** using ER-to-Relational Mapping Algorithm using MySQL.

### Motion Perception Research | R
* Built a **pipeline** in R that automatically imports, validates, transforms raw experiment data, and performs **statistical analysis** including **clustering** and **regression** to explore patterns of subject response, improved efficiency by **50%**.
